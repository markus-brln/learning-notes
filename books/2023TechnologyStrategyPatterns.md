# Technology Strategy Patterns 2023

### Intro

- Make ideas heard, harder in bigger companies with a lot of hierarchy.
- Important to get ideas heard, not vanish -> always write stuff down where it's searchable.
- People between tech and business become more important.
- Business strategy can follow from technical strategy, e.g., making small, simple, and cheap cars and marketing to
  poorer people plus building a repair network where people don't need much expertise.

### Architect Definition

- Important to choose the right framework.
- DevOps is by nature closer to architecture, good introduction.
- Simple design -> so simple that complexity that comes with requirements needs to be added later, very hard.
- Need to change strategies over time, but beware of strategy vs. tactics (more short term).
- If we want to bring senior devs closer to business, we need to give them insight (business goals, current performance,
  sales, etc.), same the other way around.

### Part 2: Creating the Strategy

- Different projects require different amounts of research and application of patterns.
- The fact that he talks about these patterns and how to persuade people to follow your strategy makes me realize how
  complex and intense big tech must be.

**Meta Techniques:**

- **MECE**
    - Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive, complete lists of 3-5 items to make other people with few time
      understand and remember.
- **Logic Trees**
    - Find the root cause of problems by making a logic chain/tree, find opportunities by imagining a better world for
      customers and going backwards ending up at technical implementation.
- **Hypothesis**
    - Define terms first.
    - Use ranges for predictions, rather than numbers with decimals.
    - Need for analytics to make decisions.
    - Don't collect too much data.

**World Context:**

- **PESTEL**
    - Political, economic, social, technological, environmental, legal context of the strategy plan.
    - Get feedback from business people.
    - Change once per year or on big world events.
- **Scenario Planning**
    - Don't assume that things will stay the same and that the do-nothing strategy will work.
    - Could be a fun exercise for myself to do once or twice per year, gathering the PESTEL and then making predictions.
- **Futures Funnel**
    - Less involved planning exercise than scenario planning, more of a visualization.
    - Sets of possible, plausible, preferred, probable futures.
    - Watch out for preferred + implausible ones.
- **Backcasting**
    - Come up with an ideal future, work backwards on steps necessary to get there from the current position, make a
      plan from that.

**Industry Context:**

- **SWOT**
    - Matrix of internal vs. external, helpful vs. harmful.
    - Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats.
    - Gather information about weaknesses in people, process, and organization in the company, and about business
      opportunities they see.
- **Porter's Five Forces**
    - Forces on businesses that determine competitive advantage.
    - Threat of new entrants.
        - Higher entrance barriers, lower exit barriers are good.
    - Threat of substitution.
        - Likelihood to have another product substitute yours.
    - Supplier power.
        - Power of raw material, workforce suppliers.
    - Buyer power.
        - How much can customers change your product.
    - Competition among rivals.
- **Ansoff Growth Matrix**
    - How to grow the business along different axes.
    - New vs. current markets, new vs. current products.

**Corporate Context:**

- **Stakeholder Alignment**
    - Do stuff that matters to people who matter.
    - Make sure that the project you think matters to the company also matters to those with the power to decide about
      them.
- **Value Chain**
    - Discover where the money of your company is being made (diverse streams in bigger companies), adjust technology
      strategy accordingly.
- **Growth Share Matrix**
    - Where do the products fall on market growth vs. market share matrix -> treat differently in terms of resources put
      into them.
- **Current and Future State Operating Model**
    - Current model vs. new model 2-column table.
    - Nice maybe for workflow to describe their ideas.
- **Principles, Practices, Tools Sankey Diagram**
    - How those 3 connect to each other.
    - Good for overview.
- **Product Rule**
    - Percentages like e.g., customer dropoff need to be multiplied to arrive at the final number.
    - Usually more optimization to do than expected.
- **APM**
    - Application Portfolio Management.
    - Decide which applications to direct resources to, strategic vs. noncritical apps.
    - Keeping the business value of the applications in mind.

### Part 3: Communication Approach Patterns

- **30-Second Answer**
    - Keep it short, people are busy.
    - Not showing off how smart you are.
- **Rented Brain**
    - Hire consultants or not.
    - Boss shouldn't be angry about bad news - teaches employees to hide it.
    - Act as if you were a consultant, speak the truth.
    - Find another gig if the superiors can't handle the truth, "it's over anyway."
- **Ars Rhetorica**
    - Logical, ethical, and emotional arguments.
- **Fait Accompli**
    - People like change, just not when it's imposed on them.
    - ^^^Need to include them in the process! Have extra smaller meetings beforehand.
    - People in meetings often ask themselves what's in it for me / how does this affect me?
- **Dramatic Structure**
    - Structure the story of your idea in 5 acts like every other story basically.
    - 1 Exposition, 2. Special event, 3. Nothing can ever be the same again, 4. The plan, 5. The new normal.
     - If you can't fill all 5 acts, then something is wrong with your strategy.
- **Deconstruction**
    - Solve problems for local optima can perpetuate bad overall direction in the long run, e.g., need to make a new
      stack at some point and stop fixing the old one.
    - Think about how to not have problems, then you don't need to solve them. Tackle bigger problems that also solve
      the smaller ones.
- **Scalable Business Machines**
    - Hero culture bad, where people get rewarded too much for fixing stuff, distraction from smart planning.
    - When asked about time/cost estimates of complex projects, say that you don't know if you don't know, give a range
      maybe. Be clear if your estimate is a rough estimate.
- **Architecture Definition**
    - Looks like design documents.
- **MergeSort Meeting**
    - Seems like he asks a lot of preparation from the participants of his meetings.
- **Bringing It All Together**
    - He's been convincing me more and more that a good plan is necessary, and we should take time for that. However, 
      the question is who should do it at what level. Probably having each dev do these kinds of in-depth analyses is
      not that effective. Need to find a good balance of planning vs executing, based on your position in a team.
