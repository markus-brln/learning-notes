# The Kubernetes Book

- General: Could skip hands-on examples if you already worked with kubernetes a bit, but there are still some bits of
  knowledge in there that the theory sections don't have. Examples can mostly be applied to microk8s as well.
- Chapters 1+2 basic understanding of kubernetes - absolute requirement to get started
- Terminology section at the end - a lot of useful info with few reading, get vocabulary, highly recommend to read at
  the beginning and after finishing reading
- Chapters 4-8+12 Pods, Namespaces, Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps+Secrets - still very nice to read early
  on in your journey
- Chapter 9 WebAssembly - more of an interlude
- Chapters 10-X - more advanced topics, not strictly necessary for beginners
